This R notebook based in the markdown and R language contains example code for the first session of the R course.
Here, we will learn how to perform basic operations in R, get to know the different data formats and play around with the [stats](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html) package.

# Variables and the assignment operator

First, we will learn how to save a number (e.g. `12`) in a variable (e.g. `a`).
For this, we will use the assignment operator `<-` (and not `=`).

```{r example-variable}
a <- 12
a
```

The reason we don't use `=` is because it's reserved for setting parameters within a function call:

```{r example-assignment}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 12)
var(x = a)
```

However, `var(x <- a)` will also work, but it will generate an object `x`, which is equal to `a`.
