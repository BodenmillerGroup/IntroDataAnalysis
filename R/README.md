# Example and instruction scripts for the R sessions

This folder contains the scripts that are discussed in the different R sessions.

## Session 1

**Introduction to RStudio:**

I will give an overview on the functionality of RStudio and how to easily create R markdown scripts.
Aim of this exercise is to become familiar with the minimal setup needed for reproducible data analysis.
One crucial part of writing readable code is its annotation.
This is facilitated by the mardown language in junction with R code. 

**Basic operations:**

You will learn how to perform basic operations in R and get to know the basics data formats.
