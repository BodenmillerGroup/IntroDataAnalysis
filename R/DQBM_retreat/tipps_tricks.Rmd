```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Concepts taken from [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html).

## Assignment operator and pipes

## Efficient coding

### Reading in data

`read.csv` vs `read_cvs` vs `data.table` vs `vroom`

### Loops and apply

### Parallelisation

## Object-oriented coding

Mainly relevant for development and not analysis but good to understand



S3 vs S4 vs R6

Very opinionated and preference due to developing for Bioconductor --> use S4

## Common pitfalls

Vector recycling

the `drop` argument

## Recommendations on coding style

Avoid copying code and modularize (the `source` command)





```{r, sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
