# Introduction to data analysis in R and python

The main purpose of this repository is to collect example data and instruction scripts to highlight key features of the R and python programming languages.
Training sessions are divided into [R](../master/R) and [python](../master/python) training.
All example data are centrally available from the [Data](../master/Data) folder.

## Things to install

To maximise the time spend on actual hands-on training in both languages, please install the following software specified for the different sessions:

### R

* Install R from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) or make sure that you have R version 3.6.1 (or higher) installed.
