# Introduction to data analysis in R and python

The main purpose of this repository is to collect example data and instruction scripts to highlight key features of the R and python programming languages.
Training sessions are divided into [R](../master/R) and [python](../master/python) training.
All example data are centrally available from the [Data](../master/Data) folder.

## Things to install

To maximise the time spend on actual hands-on training in both languages, please install the following software specified for the different sessions:

### R

**Session 1:**

* Install R from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) or via brew (`brew install r`) or make sure that you have R version 3.6.1 (or higher) installed.
* Install RStudio Desktop from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* Test the install by opening RStudio and typing:

```r
example(readline)
```

To knit an Rmardown (.Rmd) files, you need to install `rmarkdown` via `install.packages("rmarkdown")`.

### Python

**Session 1:**

* Install Anaconda for Python 3.7 from [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution)
* Launch “Spyder” and “Jupyter Notebook” from the Anaconda Navigator (Recommendation: install Kite if Spyder asks you whether you want to)
* Run the following command in Spyder (bottom right) and Jupyter Notebook:

```python
import this
```
