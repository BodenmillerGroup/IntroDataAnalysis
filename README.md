# Introduction to data analysis in R and python

The main purpose of this repository is to collect example data and instruction scripts to highlight key features of the R and python programming languages.
Training sessions are divided into [R](../master/R), [python](../master/python) and [Git](../master/Git) training.
All example data are centrally available from the [Data](../master/Data) folder.

**Disclaimer:** We prepared these sessions to give a very broad introduction to the R and python programming language.
These sessions should not replace university courses and might not contain all relevant topics.

## Things to install

To maximise the time spend on actual hands-on training in both languages, please install the following software specified for the different sessions: [R](../master/R) and [python](../master/python)
